# Elliot Script
The "Elliot Script" is a Python script designed to assist in wordlist generation based on personal information extracted through social engineering and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). It is inspired by a tool the character Elliot Alderson uses in the television series "Mr. Robot" and allows users to create customized wordlists for brute force attacks.
